void setup(){
	Serial.begin(9600);	//initialise Communication with PC
}

void loop(){
	Serial.print("Hello World!");	//Send characters to PC
	delay(1000);			//Delay for 1 second
}

Note the delay, this is important as the communication happens quickly and without a pause,
the data fills the screen very quickly and the communications can stop working.

Now try...
Replace the line that prints characters with...

Serial.println("Hello World!");

Note that this function includes a linefeed after the information is printed.


Serial Communication Popout box:
You will notice that a value of 9600 has been chosen for the Serial.begin() instruction.
This is not arbitrary and is known as the Serial Baud Rate. There is a set of standard values, with 9600 often being used as default on many devices.
