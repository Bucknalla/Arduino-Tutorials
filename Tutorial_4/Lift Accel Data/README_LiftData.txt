This data was gathered by placing the electronics on the floor in the lift, starting the program just as the lift
started to rise.

The lift then went up 1 floor, stopped, then down one floor, just as the lift stopped, the program was ended.

The data is in the format: x, y, z.

There seems to be a problem with the Z reading...and why is the X and Y axis changing.

(The Z axis was facing upwards)
