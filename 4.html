<p>The ability to collect data is an incredibly valuable tool to an Engineer, whether it's measuring the vibrations of traffic across a bridge to check for oscillations or to calculate the acceleration of rocket, it's essential to be able to effectively test and monitor a system.</p>

<p>Engineers in the field often need to verify that a systems is functioning correctly. This can often be a difficult task as conditions can be remote, harsh and sometimes even hostile! Fortunately tools such as a micro controller, such as an Arduino, can be employed to perform this monitoring for a far.</p>

<p>This tutorial will teach you how to interface with and collect data from a range of devices using a protocol known as SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface). This is an interface that will allow you to talk to sensors, storage and other devices. It is a general purpose protocol and can be used for a whole range of devices, beyond the Accelerometer and SD card examples used in this tutorial.</p>

<h3>Aims</h3>

<p>By completing this tutorial, you should be able to confidently -</p>

<ul>
  <li>Connect a sensor to an Arduino using the SPI bus</li>
  <li>View the live data being collected by the Arduino, on a Computer, using the built-in Serial Monitor</li>
  <li>Store this data using an SD card, allowing you to view the data at a later date</li>
</ul>
