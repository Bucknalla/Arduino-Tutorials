<p>Welcome! This is the associated guidebook for the SoE Arduino Workshops. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up the Arduino IDE as well as teaching you the basics to get you started coding! Throughout these workshops, you will learn about how to interface with sensors such as accelerometers for measuring acceleration and velocity, how to store your data onto an SD card for remote data logging and more. All of these tutorials are maintained by the <a href="https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/eng/">Warwick University School of Engineering</a></p>

<p>First of all, you will want to install the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment). If you are using one of the School's computers you will find that it is already install by navigating to the start menu and searching 'Arduino'. If you are using your own computer, navigate to the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software">Arduino Download</a> page. Select either Windows, Mac OSX or Linux depending on your operating system. </p>

<a id="installing-drivers" class="anchor" href="#installing-drivers" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Setup/Installing Drivers</h4>

<p>Once you've installed the Arduino IDE, you'll want to make sure that the drivers have installed correctly and that your Arduino Device is correctly identified. For this introduction, it is assumed that you are using an Arduino Uno. </p>

<p><strong><em>Windows (7/8/10)</em></strong></p>

<p>Run the Arduino IDE (.exe) file you just downloaded. This will install it to your Local Storage.</p>



<p>Plug your Arduino into your computer and wait for it to recognize it as an external device. If this is the first time you have connected up your Arduino, it will fail.</p>

<p>Navigate to the Start Menu and search, 'Device Manager'.</p>

<p>Under Ports (COM&amp; LPT) you should see an open port named 'Arduino UNO (COMxx)'. Right click on this and it will give you an option to 'Update Driver Software'; Click this. </p>
