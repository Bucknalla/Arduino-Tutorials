<p>Welcome! This is the associated guidebook for the SoE Arduino Workshops. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up the Arduino IDE as well as teaching you the basics to get you started coding! Throughout these workshops, you will learn about how to interface with sensors such as accelerometers for measuring acceleration and velocity, how to store your data onto an SD card for remote data logging and more. All of these tutorials are maintained by the <a href="https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/eng/">Warwick University School of Engineering</a></p>

<a id="getting-started" class="anchor" href="#getting-started" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting Started</h3>

<p>First of all, you will want to install the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment). If you are using one of the School's computers you will find that it is already install by navigating to the start menu and searching 'Arduino'. If you are using your own computer, navigate to the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software">Arduino Download</a> page. Select either Windows, Mac OSX or Linux depending on your operating system. </p>

<h4>
<a id="installing-drivers" class="anchor" href="#installing-drivers" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Setup/Installing Drivers</h4>

<p>Once you've installed the Arduino IDE, you'll want to make sure that the drivers have installed correctly and that your Arduino Device is correctly identified. For this introduction, it is assumed that you are using an Arduino Uno. </p>

<p><strong><em>Windows (7/8/10)</em></strong></p>

<p>Run the Arduino IDE (.exe) file you just downloaded. This will install it to your Local Storage.</p>



<p>Plug your Arduino into your computer and wait for it to recognize it as an external device. If this is the first time you have connected up your Arduino, it will fail.</p>

<p>Navigate to the Start Menu and search, 'Device Manager'.</p>

<p>Under Ports (COM&amp; LPT) you should see an open port named 'Arduino UNO (COMxx)'. Right click on this and it will give you an option to 'Update Driver Software'; Click this. </p>

<p><strong><em>Mac OSX</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Linux (Ubuntu)</em></strong>
Plug in your board and wait for Windows to begin its driver installation process. After a few moments, the process will fail, despite its best efforts.
Click on the Start Menu, and open up the Control Panel.
While in the Control Panel, navigate to System and Security. Next, click on System. Once the System window is up, open the Device Manager.
Look under Ports (COM &amp; LPT). You should see an open port named “Arduino UNO (COMxx)”.
Right click on the “Arduino UNO (COMxx)” port and choose the “Update Driver Software” option.
Next, choose the “Browse my computer for Driver software” option.
Finally, navigate to and select the Uno’s driver file, named “ArduinoUNO.inf”, located in the “Drivers” folder of the Arduino Software download.
Windows will finish up the driver installation from there.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-users-and-teams" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
